## What's new
A new version of the AJD has been created. The new version was created with the goal of making the HTML and SCSS more modular. Decoupling the JS is still on our roadmap but as of right now we are rolling out the HTML and SCSS changes.


## Which AJD should I use
Thats a great question! The answer is relatively simple. If you are building an AJD on a site that has never had one, use the [code for version 2](https://github.com/tmpworldwide/tb-ajd-template/tree/doc-branch/code/v2). If an AJD already exists then build any additional AJD's the same way the first AJD was built, it most likely was done with [code from version 1](https://github.com/tmpworldwide/tb-ajd-template/tree/doc-branch/code/v1)
